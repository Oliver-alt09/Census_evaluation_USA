# Census_evaluation_USA
This repository contains my first project made using ML
The Data provided is the population census of USA taken in different years.
It contains features such as region, population and year of record which are categorised as under18 and total population.
My model uses SVM to classify whether the population data is of under 18 or total population using population, year of record according to region.
The model is also cross validated to find best accuracy of model.
Further I have used Grid Search method to find the best parameters for this model.
The aim was to make it using SVM but I have also compared it with other classification algorithms.
On comparing it was found that RANDOM FOREST works best for this project.
